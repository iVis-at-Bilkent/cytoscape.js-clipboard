                // The following 4 options allow the user to provide custom behavior to
                // the extension. They can be used to maintain consistency of some data
                // when elements are duplicated.
                // These 4 options are set to null by default. The function prototypes
                // are provided below for explanation purpose only.

                // Function executed on the collection of elements being copied, before
                // they are serialized in the clipboard
                beforeCopy: function(eles) {},
                // Function executed on the clipboard just after the elements are copied.
                // clipboard is of the form: {nodes: json, edges: json}
                afterCopy: function(clipboard) {},
                // Function executed on the clipboard right before elements are pasted,
                // when they are still in the clipboard.
                beforePaste: function(clipboard) {},
                // Function executed on the collection of pasted elements, after they
                // are pasted.
                afterPaste: function(eles) {}
		// Function executed on the collection of elements being cut, before
                // they are serialized in the clipboard
		beforeCut: function(eles) {},
		// Function executed on the clipboard just after the elements are cut.
                // clipboard is of the form: {nodes: json, edges: json}
		afterCut: function(clipboard) {},

## Usage instructions

Download the library:

 * via bower: `bower install cytoscape-clipboard`, or
 * via direct download in the repository (probably from a tag).

`require()` the library as appropriate for your project:

CommonJS:
```js
var cytoscape = require('cytoscape');
var jquery = require('jquery');
var clipboard = require('cytoscape-clipboard');

clipboard( cytoscape, jquery ); // register extension
```

AMD:
```js
require(['cytoscape', 'cytoscape-clipboard'], function( cytoscape, clipboard ){
  clipboard( cytoscape ); // register extension
});
```

Plain HTML/JS has the extension registered for you automatically, because no `require()` is needed.
