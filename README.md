## Usage instructions

Download the library:
 * via npm: `npm install cytoscape-clipboard`,
 * via bower: `bower install cytoscape-clipboard`, or
 * via direct download in the repository (probably from a tag).

`require()` the library as appropriate for your project:

CommonJS:
```js
var cytoscape = require('cytoscape');
var clipboard = require('cytoscape-clipboard');

clipboard( cytoscape ); // register extension
```

AMD:
```js
require(['cytoscape', 'cytoscape-clipboard'], function( cytoscape, clipboard ){
  clipboard( cytoscape ); // register extension
});
```

Plain HTML/JS has the extension registered for you automatically, because no `require()` is needed.
